- JS - ( Javacsript)  the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage.
- Weather API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data.
- JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
- JQuery - JQuery is a concise and fast JavaScript library that can be used to simplify event handling, HTML document traversing, Ajax interactions and animation for speedy website development.
- Bootstrap (Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites).
